To do for Ben's site

- MENUS

The menus are currently images, which is easy to upload, but poor for accessibility so these need to become items that are created dynamically.

- CMS

Need to build a place that works with strapi to allow Ben to update the website.

- Contact

Could add a contact form
Could add some funky pictures
